Visual GoI is an OCaml program developped as a research and eductionnal tool to
parse several variation of lambda-calculus terms (untyped, simply typed, with
references, concurrent, etc...), translate it (via CBN (t = !a -> a), CBV (t =
!(a -> a)), ...) to GoI token machine as proof nets or compile it to
instructions (Krivine, SECD, CBV GoI machine, ...) and finally run the machine
step by step.

This tool is still at development stage, but is intended to be eventually an
fully integrated graphical web application (using Js_of_ocaml).
